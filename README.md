# GTA: Vice City — WASM Port

Play GTA: Vice City right in your browser. Nothing to install: the game runs on your own device and keeps working offline.

You need the game files (`game.tar.gz`) once — see [How it works](#how-it-works).

## What's included

- **Play in your browser.** Nothing to install, and your game files stay on your device.
- **Your own saved games.** Import, export and remove PC saves.
- **Custom skins.** Change how Tommy looks with your own images.
- **Cheats on demand.** Off by default; switch them on from the setup screen.
- **Touch controls.** On-screen controls for phones and tablets.
- **Install it as an app.** Add it to your desktop or home screen from the browser.

## How it works

1. Download `game.tar.gz`
2. Open the [live page](https://joncodeofficial.github.io/gta-vice-city-wasm/) and click **Select game.tar.gz** to import the file
3. The archive is extracted into your browser's local storage (OPFS) — this only happens once
4. Click **Start to play** and the game loads entirely from your device

Your imported data persists between sessions so you only need to import once unless you clear browser storage.

## Saves & skins

Before pressing Start, you can add your own saved games and character skins from the **Saves & skins** section.

### Saves

- Add a saved game downloaded for **GTA Vice City on PC**. Files named `GTAVCsf1.b` to `GTAVCsf8.b`, or a `.zip` containing one, both work.
- Importing into a slot that already has a save replaces it.
- You can download your saves to keep them safe.

### Skins

- Add a skin as a `.bmp`, `.png`, `.jpg` or `.zip` file. It is adjusted automatically.
- Once in game, open *Options → Player Skin Setup*, pick your skin and leave the menu to put it on.
- Skins only change Tommy's everyday outfit.

If your download is a `.rar` or `.7z`, unpack it first. *Reset game data* also deletes your saves and skins.

## Requirements

- A modern desktop browser with WebAssembly + OPFS + Service Worker support
- Recommended: Chrome 110+, Firefox 111+, or Safari 16.4+
- The `game.tar.gz` game archive (~668 MB compressed)

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Tech stack

- **Vite** — dev server and build tool
- **WebAssembly** — game engine compiled from C++ via Emscripten
- **OPFS** (Origin Private File System) — stores extracted game data locally in the browser
- **Service Worker** — intercepts fetch requests to serve game files from OPFS
- **Web Worker** — extracts the `.tar.gz` archive off the main thread
